## Introduction

This document outlines the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) strategy for our project, which involves financial data processing and a billing system.

## Development Language
Python

## Architecture
Docker
Jenkins
Git

## Service
Open Source

## Development Approach
Agile

## Release Frequency
Pre-production: 1 release every 2 weeks
Production: 1 release per month

## CI/CD Strategy
Branching Strategy

I have chosen the Gitflow workflow for branching strategy. Here's why:

**Main Branch:** The main branch holds production-ready code. It is a stable branch used for deployments to the production environment.

**Dev Branch:** The dev branch is where ongoing development work happens. It's a central hub for all feature development and bug fixes.

**Feature Branches:** We create feature branches for specific tasks and features, allowing for isolation and organized development.

## CI Pipeline
Our CI pipeline in Jenkins follows these steps:

**Checkout:** The pipeline starts by checking out the latest code from the dev branch.

**Build:** We install project dependencies and perform the necessary build steps.

**Test:** Python tests are executed to ensure code quality.

**Publish Test Results:** Test results are published for review.

**Push to GitHub:** Changes are pushed back to the dev branch for collaboration.

## CD Pipeline
Our CD pipeline follows a simplified approach:

**Release to main:** After thorough testing and verification, code from the develop branch is merged into the release/main branch.

**Merge to main:** Once the release branch is thoroughly tested and ready for production, we merge it into the main branch to deploy to production.
